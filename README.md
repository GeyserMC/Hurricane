# GeyserHacks
Various workarounds for Geyser players that modify the server in order to achieve their goal.

Issues with each workaround are listed in the plugin's config. **Please take your time to read them as the workarounds in this plugin can be used for exploitative purposes.**

Fixes:
- Bamboo and dripstone collision (by setting them to no server-side collision)
- https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/638 by implementing the control server-side.
- https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/1741 by adding the sweeping edge level to the lore of the item. Also sweeping edge now works in the anvil because this fix adds unbreaking 1 to the 2nd slot in the anvil if that slot contains a sweeping edge only book.

Supported Versions:
- 1.14.x - 1.19.x
- 1.17.x & above for pig riding

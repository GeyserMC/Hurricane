# Hurricane

## Fixes:
- Bamboo and dripstone collision (by setting them to no server-side collision)
- Allow Geyser players to ride pigs (by implementing the control server-side.) (Doesn't work on 1.20+)

## Supported Versions:
- 1.14.x - 1.20.x for bamboo and dripstone collision fixes 
- 1.17.x - 1.19.x for pig riding
